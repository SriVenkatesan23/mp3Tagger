# mp3Tagger
This desktop application automatically tags all mp3 files in directory with the proper song title, artist, album, and album cover. This application is best used for individually downloaded mp3s, but can be used for albums as well as long as file names are formatted properly.


##How Can I Use It?

Run the application. You have two options: you can click the "File" tab at the top right and hit "Select Directory", or just paste the directory address in the text box and hit the button below.

1) Make sure your mp3 filenames are in the following format: "Artist - Album - Song Name".

2) Save your album cover image with the name of the album (supports most commonly used image file extensions)


###Example:

mp3 filename: *Michael Jackson - Thriller - Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'*

image file: *Thriller*


###In Progress:

1) Currently integrating MP3Tagger with the Spotify API so that, in case the user does not include album art in the directory, the software will browse Spotify and find the appropriate art

2) Reworking UI to make it more visually appealing
